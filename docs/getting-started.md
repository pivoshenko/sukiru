# First steps with Kasetto

After [installing Kasetto](./installation.md), you can check that it is available by running the
`kst` command:

```console
$ kst
An extremely fast AI skills manager

Usage: kst <COMMAND>

...
```

You should see a help menu listing the available commands.

## Creating a config

Create a `kasetto.yaml` in your project to declare the skills you want:

```yaml
agent: claude-code

skills:
  - source: https://github.com/org/skill-pack
    branch: main
    skills:
      - code-reviewer
      - name: design-system
```

!!! tip

    Use the `agent` field to target any of the [35+ supported agents](./agents.md), or use the
    `destination` field for a custom install path.

## Syncing skills

Run `kst sync` to install the declared skills:

```console
$ kst sync
Syncing skills from 1 source...
  ✓ code-reviewer (installed)
  ✓ design-system (installed)
Synced 2 skills in 1.2s
```

Kasetto reads the config, pulls the skills, and installs them into the right agent directory.
Next time you run `sync`, only changed skills are updated.

## Syncing from a remote config

Kasetto can fetch configs from any HTTPS URL — useful for sharing a single config across a team:

```console
$ kst sync --config https://example.com/team-skills.yaml
```

## Previewing changes

Use `--dry-run` to preview what would change without writing anything:

```console
$ kst sync --dry-run
Would install: code-reviewer, design-system
Would remove: old-skill
```

## Exploring what's installed

Browse installed skills interactively:

```console
$ kst list
```

Navigate with ++j++ / ++k++, scroll with ++page-up++ / ++page-down++, jump with ++g++ ++g++ / ++shift+g++.
Set `NO_TUI=1` or pipe the output to get plain text instead.

Check your local setup:

```console
$ kst doctor
```

This prints version, manifest DB path, installation paths, last sync time, and any failed skills.

## Using JSON output

All commands support `--json` for scripting and CI:

```console
$ kst sync --json
$ kst list --json
$ kst doctor --json
```

## Next steps

See the [configuration reference](./configuration.md) for the full config schema, or browse the
[commands reference](./commands.md) for all available flags.
